# Overview Supply Chain and Logistics (Using Microsoft PowerBi)
## Project Overview
This project uses a comprehensive dataset that models an end-to-end supply chain, production, and sales ecosystem for a global consumer electronics company.
The data integrates master data and transactional data to enable deep analysis of business performance, operational efficiency, and profitability across regions, facilities, products, and customers.
The dataset is well-suited for Excel dashboards, Power BI reports, SQL analysis, and data analytics projects.

## Dataset Used
Your dataset represents an end-to-end supply chain and sales ecosystem, combining master data (customers, products, suppliers, facilities, and dates) with transactional data (inventory, procurement, production, sales, and shipments). It enables detailed analysis of operations, costs, quality, logistics, and profitability across the entire business lifecycle.
The structure supports time-based trend analysis and performance comparisons across regions, facilities, and sales channels. Supplier and procurement data help evaluate lead times, quality, and sourcing efficiency. Inventory and production tables enable demand planning, stock optimization, and defect analysis. Sales data links revenue and profit to customers and products, while shipment data tracks delivery performance and logistics costs.
